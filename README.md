# Quantum Channel Discrimination

Final project of the UPC Quantum Engineering postgraduate.
Tutor: Matteo Rosati
Students: Jesus Huerta, Albert Solana

We are following the paper [Discriminating qubit amplitude damping channels](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.01000.pdf) to understand the experiments and results described to optimize the input and measurement steps to discriminate amplitude damping channels.

In this repository there will be the documentation and quantum experiments implemented on IVM Qiskit tool.
